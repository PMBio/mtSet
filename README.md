mtSet
======

Set tests are a powerful approach for genome-wide association testing between groups of genetic variants and individual quantitative traits.
mtSet is a python implementation of efficient algorithms for joint analysis across multiple traits, while accounting for relatedness.

The implementation is in Python and builds on the Gaussian process toolbox in pygp (https://github.com/PMBio/pygp) and the linear mixed model library LIMIX (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/limix).

## Requirements

mtSet requires LIMIX (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/limix)

## How to use mtSet?

A demo that shows how to use mtSet can is at https://github.com/PMBio/mtSet/blob/master/demos/arab_demos.py

Extensive documentation will be available soon.
